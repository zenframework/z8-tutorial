	The priority of fonts configuration file is as following:
	Two major levels of configuration files:
	1. Configuration files without format in name are divided into three sub-levels:
		a. default configuration file: fontsConfig.xml
		b. configuration files specified for special platform: fontsConfig_Windows_XP.xml or fontsConfig_win32.xml.
		c. configuration files specified for special platform and special locale: fontsConfig_win32_zh.xml/fontsConfig_win32_zh_CN.xml
	2. Configuration files with format in name are also divided into 3 sub-levels:
		d. default configuration files for a format: fontsConfig_pdf.xml
		e. configuration files for a format under special platform: fontsConfig_pdf_win32.xml
		f. configuration files for a format under special platform: fontsConfig_pdf_win32_zh.xml
	From level a to level f, the priority of configuration files increase.
	
	The logic how a single configuration is loaded and used is described below:
	1. 	PDF layout engine loads the font files from the fonts folder of the plug-in 
	"org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.fonts". and then the system defined font
	folder. If the section <font-paths> is set in fontsConfig.xml, the system 
	defined font folder will be ignored, and the font files specified in section 
	<font-paths> will be loaded instead.
	
	2. 	PDF layout engine tries to use the font specified in design-time to render the pdf/postscript/ppt. 
	If the font is a generic family, it will be mapped to a PDF embedded type1 font. 	
	"serif" to "Times-Roman" 
	"fantasy" to "Times-Roman" 
	"sans-serif" to "Helvetica"
	"monospace" to "Courier"
	"cursive" to "Times-Roman"
	If the font can not be built, it will go to the UNICODE block of that character,
	and try the font defined in that block.
	If this also fails, the character will be replaced with '?' using the default font, 
	currently "Times-Roman", to denote a place of missing character.

<font>
<!--
	In <font-aliases> section, you can:
	a. Define a mapping from a generic family to a font family.
		for example: the following defines a mapping from generic family "serif" to a Type1 font
		family "Times-Roman".
			<mapping name="serif" font-family="Times-Roman"/>
			
	b. Define a mapping from a font family to another font family.
		This is useful if you want to use a font for PDF rendering which differs from the font used
	in design-time. 
		for example: the following defines to replace "simsun" with "Arial Unicode MS".
			<mapping name="simsun" font-family="Arial Unicode MS"/>
			
	In previous version, name "font-mapping" is used for "font-aliases". Currently, "font-mapping" entry
	also works in the same way as "font-aliases" entry does. When "font-mapping" and "font-aliases" are
	both available, the different mappings are merged, for the same entries in the both, those in
	"font-aliases" will override those in "font-mapping".
-->
	<font-aliases>
		<mapping name="serif" font-family="Roboto" />
		<mapping name="sans-serif" font-family="Roboto" />
		<mapping name="monospace" font-family="Roboto" />
		<mapping name="cursive" font-family="Roboto" />
		<mapping name="fantasy" font-family="Roboto" />
	</font-aliases>

	<composite-font name="all-fonts" font-family="Roboto">
	</composite-font>

<!--
	In this section, you can set the font path you want PDF layout engine to read, ranging from one font
	file to a whole font folder.
		for example: 
		add a font folder
		<path path="c:/windows/fonts"/>
		add a font file
		<path path="/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TTF/arial.ttf"/>

	But please NOTE:
 		If this section is set, PDF layout engine will ONLY load the font files in these paths and ignore
	the system defined font folder. If you want to use the system font folder as well, please include
	it in this section. 
 	
 	On some systems, BIRT PDF layout engine may not recognize the system defined font folder. If you encounter
	this issue, please add the font path to this section.
